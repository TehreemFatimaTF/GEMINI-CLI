🎨 Canva Replica Project
🧩 Overview

This project is a replica of the Canva landing page, built using Gemini CLI, Google’s powerful AI command-line tool.
The goal was to recreate the Canva design from a given screenshot with pixel-perfect accuracy, matching its background, layout, and typography exactly.

🚀 Project Description

The Canva Replica demonstrates how Gemini CLI can be used to convert visual designs into fully functional HTML and CSS code with high precision.
The system analyzes the provided image (canva_ss.png) and generates web code that closely mirrors the original Canva landing page design — including colors, fonts, spacing, and element alignment.

Through iterative refinement, the design was tuned until it matched the visual feel, balance, and structure of the original Canva interface.
