# Canva Replica

This project is a replica of the Canva landing page, created using the Gemini CLI.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to replicate the visual design of a Canva landing page based on a screenshot. The Gemini CLI was used to generate the HTML and CSS code, with a focus on matching the background, layout, and font styles as closely as possible to the provided image.

## How it was built
This project was built interactively with the Gemini CLI. The process involved:
1.  Creating the project directory.
2.  Analyzing a screenshot of the desired design.
3.  Generating `index.html` and `style.css` files.
4.  Iteratively refining the CSS to match the background, font styles, and element positioning based on user feedback.
5.  Using the provided screenshot (`canva_ss.png`) as the exact background image to achieve pixel-perfect replication of the visual design.

## Files
-   `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the page.
-   `style.css`: The CSS rules for styling the page.
-   `canva_ss.png`: The screenshot used as the visual reference and as the background image for the replica.

## How to view
Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the replica.
